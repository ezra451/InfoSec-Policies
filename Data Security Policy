## 5. Procedures
  5.1 Data Classification
    5.1.1 Classification Tiers: All organizational data, including customer data, sensitive data, PHI, and PII, shall be classified into one of the following tiers based on its sensitivity, impact of compromise, and regulatory requirements. Information Security will maintain detailed guidelines for each tier.
    
    Public: Data intended for public consumption, where disclosure would cause no harm to the organization or individuals (e.g., marketing materials, press releases).
    
    Internal Use Only: Data that is not intended for public release but whose unauthorized disclosure would cause minimal or no harm (e.g., internal memos, general meeting minutes).
    
    Confidential: Data that is sensitive and whose unauthorized disclosure could cause moderate harm to the organization or individuals (e.g., internal financial reports, unreleased product designs, internal HR documents, non-sensitive customer data). Access is restricted to authorized personnel with a legitimate business need.
    
    Strictly Confidential/Restricted: Data that is highly sensitive and whose unauthorized disclosure could cause severe or catastrophic harm to the organization or individuals, including significant legal, financial, or reputational damage. This tier specifically includes all PHI, PII, sensitive customer financial data, trade secrets, intellectual property, and other critical financial or legal data. Access is strictly limited to a small, authorized group on a need-to-know basis.
    
    5.1.2 Data Owner Responsibility: Each data asset shall have an assigned Data Owner (typically the department head or manager responsible for the data's creation or management). Data Owners are responsible for determining the initial classification of their data assets and reviewing classifications periodically. For PHI and PII, specific individuals or roles (e.g., Privacy Officer) may be designated as primary Data Owners or co-owners.
    
    5.1.3 Classification Review: Data classifications shall be reviewed:
    Annually by the Data Owner.
    Whenever there is a significant change in the data's use, content, or regulatory requirements.
    As part of a data security risk assessment.

### 5.2 Data Labeling
    5.2.1 Document Labeling: All electronic and physical documents containing organizational data, especially customer data, sensitive data, PHI, and PII, shall be labeled according to their assigned data classification.
    
    Electronic Documents: Labels shall be embedded within the document (e.g., header/footer, watermark) and/or applied via metadata and file naming conventions. Automated labeling tools should be used where available.
    
    Physical Documents: Labels shall be clearly marked on the first page and/or cover of the document.
    
    5.2.2 Email Labeling: Emails containing Confidential or Strictly Confidential/Restricted data (including customer data, sensitive data, PHI, or PII) shall include the appropriate classification in the subject line or body.
    
    5.2.3 Verbal Information: When discussing Confidential or Strictly Confidential/Restricted information (including customer data, sensitive data, PHI, or PII), participants should be explicitly reminded of the sensitivity level.
  
  5.3 Permissions and Access Control
    5.3.1 Principle of Least Privilege: Access to all data, regardless of classification, shall be granted based on the principle of least privilege. Users shall only have access to the data necessary for their job functions. This is critically important for customer data, sensitive data, PHI, and PII.
    
    5.3.2 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Access permissions shall primarily be managed through role-based access control (RBAC), with roles defined based on job function and associated data access requirements.
    
    5.3.3 Access Reviews: Data access permissions shall be reviewed at least semi-annually by Data Owners and Enterprise IT to ensure their continued appropriateness. For PHI and PII, these reviews shall be more frequent (e.g., quarterly) or upon a change in job role.
    
    5.3.4 Segregation of Duties: Where feasible, segregation of duties shall be implemented to prevent a single individual from having control over all aspects of a critical data process, particularly for processes involving customer data, PHI, or PII.
      
      5.3.5 Secure Authentication: Strong authentication mechanisms, including multi-factor authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data and systems, shall be enforced. This is mandatory for systems storing or processing customer data, sensitive data, PHI, or PII.
  
  5.4 Storage in Approved Locations
    5.4.1 Approved Storage Locations: Data shall only be stored in locations explicitly approved by Information Security and Enterprise IT. Approved locations include:
    
    Corporate network drives and file servers.
    
    Approved cloud storage services (e.g., Microsoft 365 SharePoint, Google Drive Enterprise) with appropriate security configurations and data residency considerations for customer data, PHI, and PII.
    
    Databases hosted on approved servers.
    
    Physical storage facilities with appropriate environmental and access controls.
    
    5.4.2 Prohibited Storage Locations: Storing organizational data, especially customer data, sensitive data, PHI, or PII, on unauthorized personal devices, unapproved cloud services, external hard drives, or removable media without explicit authorization and appropriate controls (e.g., encryption) is strictly prohibited.
    
    5.4.3 Data Encryption at Rest: Strictly Confidential/Restricted data (including PHI, PII, and highly sensitive customer data) stored on servers, databases, and portable devices shall be encrypted at rest using strong encryption algorithms.
    
    5.4.4 Physical Security: Physical storage locations for hard copy documents containing Confidential or Strictly Confidential/Restricted data (including customer data, sensitive data, PHI, or PII) shall be secured with appropriate physical access controls (e.g., locked cabinets, restricted access rooms, surveillance).
  
  5.5 Retention Schedule Adherence and Secure Disposal
    5.5.1 Data Retention Schedule: Information Security, in consultation with Legal, Compliance, and Data Owners, shall maintain an official data retention schedule for all data types. This schedule shall specifically address retention periods for customer data, sensitive data, PHI, and PII, ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA). This schedule shall specify the minimum and maximum retention periods based on legal, regulatory, and business requirements.
    
    5.5.2 Adherence to Schedule: All employees and departments are responsible for adhering to the data retention schedule. Data, especially customer data, sensitive data, PHI, and PII, shall not be retained longer than necessary.
    
    5.5.3 Secure Disposal: When data reaches the end of its retention period or is no longer required for business purposes, it shall be securely disposed of in a manner appropriate to its classification.
    
    Electronic Data: Electronic data, particularly customer data, sensitive data, PHI, or PII, shall be securely erased, wiped, or degaussed from all storage media, rendering it unrecoverable. Simple deletion is not considered secure disposal for sensitive data.
    
    Physical Documents: Physical documents containing Confidential or Strictly Confidential/Restricted data (including customer data, sensitive data, PHI, or PII) shall be shredded, incinerated, or otherwise rendered unreadable.
    
    Asset Disposal: All IT assets (e.g., hard drives, mobile devices) containing organizational data, especially customer data, sensitive data, PHI, or PII, shall undergo a certified secure data sanitization process before disposal or repurposing. Documentation of disposal shall be maintained.
    
    5.5.4 Automated Disposal: Where technically feasible, automated tools and processes shall be used to enforce retention policies and facilitate secure data disposal.
  
  5.6 Data Handling Procedures
    5.6.1 Data in Transit: When transmitting Confidential or Strictly Confidential/Restricted data (including customer data, sensitive data, PHI, or PII) over external or untrusted networks, strong encryption (e.g., TLS 1.2+, SFTP, secure email gateways) must be used.
    
    5.6.2 Data Loss Prevention (DLP): DLP solutions shall be implemented to monitor and prevent unauthorized transmission or exfiltration of sensitive data, with particular emphasis on customer data, PHI, and PII.
    
    5.6.3 Backup and Recovery: Regular, encrypted backups of all critical data, including customer data, sensitive data, PHI, and PII, shall be performed and securely stored. Backup media shall be protected in accordance with the data's classification. Data recovery procedures shall be tested periodically to ensure continuity of operations.
    
    5.6.4 Third-Party Data Sharing: Sharing organizational data, especially customer data, sensitive data, PHI, or PII, with third parties (e.g., vendors, partners) shall only occur under a signed agreement that includes robust data protection clauses, consistent with this policy and relevant regulations (e.g., Business Associate Agreements for PHI under HIPAA). Due diligence on third-party security practices shall be conducted before entering into agreements.
    
    5.6.5 De-identification/Anonymization: Where appropriate and permissible, PHI and PII should be de-identified or anonymized when it is no longer necessary to maintain identifiable information, especially for analytical or research purposes, to further mitigate risk.
  
  5.7 Policy Review and Enforcement
    5.7.1 Review: This Data Security Policy shall be reviewed at least annually by Information Security, in consultation with Legal and relevant stakeholders, and updated as necessary to reflect changes in legal requirements (e.g., new privacy laws), threats, technologies, and business processes.
  
  5.7.2 Enforcement: Non-compliance with this policy, particularly regarding the handling of customer data, sensitive data, PHI, or PII, may result in severe disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contractual agreements. Legal action and regulatory penalties may also be pursued where applicable.
