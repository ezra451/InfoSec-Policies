5. Process Architecture
The following processes are established and governed by this policy to manage data throughout its lifecycle.

5.1 Access Approval
When a new user or role requires access to a data asset, the Data Owner for that asset must formally approve the request. The request will be vetted to ensure it adheres to the principle of least privilege and is required for a legitimate business purpose.

5.2 Access Review
Data Owners, in collaboration with Data Custodians, are responsible for a periodic review of all data access permissions. This review, conducted at least semi-annually, verifies that all users and roles still require the level of access they have been granted, and adjusts permissions as needed.

5.3 Content Creation
All new data assets, upon creation, must be assigned a Data Owner and a sensitivity label. This process ensures that data is managed and protected from its inception.

5.4 Content Review
Data Owners are responsible for conducting periodic reviews of their data assets. This process includes verifying data accuracy, confirming its correct classification and labeling, and ensuring that it is being retained in accordance with the official data retention schedule. This process is crucial for upholding the data minimization principle.

6. Tool Governance
All tools, applications, and services that are used to create, process, store, or transmit organizational data must be reviewed and approved by the Data Governance Board. This review ensures that all tools comply with the organization's security, privacy, and architecture standards before being deployed.

7. Compliance and Enforcement
Non-compliance with this policy will be handled in accordance with the enforcement procedures outlined in the data security policy, with violations potentially leading to disciplinary action or other penalties.
